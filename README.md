# Notes Terminal
### Notes taking application through Terminal(Command Prompt)
- This Note taking application contains all the necessary operations which can be needed in a standard note taking application.
- User can take notes from his `terminal` and no need to install any external note taking application for it.
- This application can perform `CRUD` operations in order to create, read, update and delete the note.
- I've used `yargs` package to build interactive command line tools, by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.
- Used `cli-color` package for colors, formatting and other goodies for the console.
- The main reason behind using `cli-color` package over other packages is that this package won't mess with built-ins and provides neat way to predefine formatting patterns.
